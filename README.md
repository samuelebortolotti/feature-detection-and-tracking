# Feature detection and tracking

Feture detection and tracking is a collection of methods concerning feature detection and tracking in videos, developed for the `Computer Vision` course of the master's degree program in Computer Science at the University of Trento.

## Requirements

The code as-is runs in Python 3.9 with the following dependencies:

- [opencv](https://opencv.org/)

And the following development dependencies:

- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your PC.

Moreover, to facilitate the use of the application, a Makefile has been provided; to see its functions, simply call the appropriate help command with [GNU/Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

 ```bash
 make help
 ```

1. Clone the repository

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/samuelebortolotti/feature-detection-and-tracking.git
 cd feature-detection-and-tracking
 ```

2. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: it might be convenient to create a virtual enviroment to handle the dependencies.

> The `Makefile` provides a simple and convenient way to manage Python virtual environments (see [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)).
> In order to create the virtual enviroment and install the requirements be sure you have the Python 3.9 (it should work even with more recent versions, however I have tested it only with 3.9)
> ```bash
> make env
> source ./venv/fdt/bin/activate
> make install
> ```
> Remember to deactivate the virtual enviroment once you have finished dealing with the project
> ```bash
> deactivate
> ```

3. Generate the code documentation

The automatic code documentation is provided [Sphinx v4.5.0](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

In order to have the code documentation available, you need to install the development requirements:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

Since Sphinx commands are quite verbose, I suggest you to employ the following commands using the `Makefile`.

```bash
make doc-layout
make layout
```

The generated documentation will be accessible by opening `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser, or equivalently by running

```bash
make open-doc
```

However, for the sake of completness one may want to run the full Sphinx commands listed here:

```bash
sphinx-quickstart docs --sep --no-batchfile --project feature-detection-and-tracking --author "Samuele Bortolotti"  -r 0.1  --language en --extensions sphinx.ext.autodoc --extensions sphinx.ext.napoleon --extensions sphinx.ext.viewcode --extensions myst_parser
sphinx-apidoc -P -o docs/source .
cd docs; make html
```

> **Note**: executing the second list of command will lead to a slightly different documentation with respec to the one generated by the `Makefile`.
> This is because the above listed commands do not customize the index file of Sphinx. This is because the above listed commands do not customise the index file of Sphinx.
